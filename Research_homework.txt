1. What is .gitignore? You can write the answer either in Korean or English.
it specifies files to intentionally not track/ignore. Usefull when you want to exclude certain files to be pushed into 
github repository. gitignore is a good alternative to just not adding the file because when the project becomes big, it 
can be tedieous to add the files one by one. instead, you can add all the files at once and only exclude certain files that
you do not want to include.

2. Why do Github users need an SSH key pair? (Users can use either SSH key pair or github account info.) Please write down a brief explanation of SSH key.
When you add a SSH key to your github account, you can connect to github without typing our id and password each time. 
A SSH key is also useful because it can grant access to multiple parties without sharing passwords.
